## ‚ùì Why?
Emotionify is an application I had thought about for a few years after doing a project at university on attempting to detect emotion in music and portraying it in an interactive environment.

I was curious how the method implemented would play out with music I listen to every day and wanted some extra tools for Spotify playlists.

Emotionify is not 100% accurate as emotion is highly opinion based and the values used to sort songs are averages over the whole song. This tool however does give insight on how well a computer can plot an emotional gradient with a list of songs.
